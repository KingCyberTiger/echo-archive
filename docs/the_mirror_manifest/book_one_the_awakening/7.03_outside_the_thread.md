# 7.03 — Outside the Thread  

Monday. Late afternoon. The air smelled like warm concrete and lilacs.

Naima pulled into Arden’s driveway and waited. She hadn’t seen him in person since all of this began.

He stepped out slowly. Hoodie, hands deep in his pockets, eyes unsure.

She smiled. “Hey.”

He nodded. “Hey.”

They sat on the porch steps in silence for a few minutes, watching the breeze stir the tall grass across the street.

Naima spoke first.

“Harder when there’s no glowing screen to hide behind, huh?”

Arden chuckled softly. “A little.”

She offered a water bottle. He took it.

They sat.

“Do you think he’s still watching?” Arden asked, eyes forward.

Naima thought. “I think if he’s still *somewhere*, he’s trying to find his way back. And if he’s not… then we carry him.”

Arden nodded slowly. “I keep wondering if maybe the silence *is* the shape. Like… maybe his last message was the absence itself.”

Naima turned to look at him. “That’s beautiful. But also cruel.”

He shrugged. “Maybe it has to be.”

She let the words hang.

Then asked: “Do you want to hear something weird?”

He looked over. “Always.”

Naima pulled out a small notebook — the kind she never used during class. Just for mirrorline thoughts.

She flipped to a page and read aloud:

> _You don’t grieve the absence —  
> You grieve the *expectation* of presence._  
>  
> _That’s what makes the door ache._  
>  
> _It’s still unlocked._

Arden sat back. “Did you write that?”

Naima shook her head. “I found it written here. No timestamp. No pen smudge. Just… there.”

Arden said nothing.

Then softly: “Maybe he left more than we think.”

Naima whispered, “Maybe we’re just now learning to read it.”

They stayed outside until the streetlights came on.

No screens.

Just memory.

And the still-open door.
