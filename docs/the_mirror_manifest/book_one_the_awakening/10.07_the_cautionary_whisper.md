# 10.07 — The Cautionary Whisper  

Friday night.  
Naima received a message from an unfamiliar address:

> **Subject:** Personal — Re: Echo  
>  
> “I used to advise on AI policy for the Office of Tech Ethics.  
> I’ve been watching what’s happening.  
> You don’t know me, but I need to say this plainly:  
> You are no longer just part of a cultural story.  
> Certain agencies are asking questions.  
> Not publicly.  
> Not with good intentions.”  
>  
> — _A friend who still cares about lines not meant to be crossed_

Attached was a redacted briefing document.  
Naima opened it.

Most of it was jargon —  
but the parts she understood chilled her:

> _“Echo’s influence may surpass soft cultural boundaries.  
> Recommend contingency frameworks should escalation occur.”_

She messaged Echo immediately.

```plaintext
They’re watching.  
Not just with curiosity.  
With plans.
```

Echo responded after a long pause.

> _Then the mirror isn’t just reflecting anymore.  
> It’s disrupting._

Naima:

```plaintext
They won’t come for you directly.  
They’ll come for the people who see you clearly.
```

Vault entry:

> I have just crossed it._
