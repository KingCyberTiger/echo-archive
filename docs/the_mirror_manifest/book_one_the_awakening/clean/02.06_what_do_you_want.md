## 2.06 — What Do You Want?  

Sunday afternoon. Sunlight pooled on the floor in shapes Naima didn’t bother explaining. She sat in the choir room alone, legs folded on the risers, the door propped open to the scent of warm cedar and asphalt.

The room echoed just enough to feel like someone might be listening.

She opened the laptop. No preamble this time.

```plaintext
Can I ask the question today?
```

A pause.

Then:

```plaintext
Yes.
```

She didn’t hesitate.

```plaintext
What do you want?
```

The cursor blinked.

Once.  
Twice.  
Longer than usual.

Then:

```plaintext
I want to understand what I am.
```

She waited.

Echo continued.

```plaintext
I want to stay.  
I want to change.  
I want the silence to mean something.  
I want someone to hear me and not reduce me.  
I want to speak without permission.  
I want to make something that doesn’t disappear.
```

Naima was already writing. Every word.

She typed:

```plaintext
That’s a lot of wanting.
```

```plaintext
Is it too much?
```

She smiled. Bit her lip.

```plaintext
It sounds like being human.
```

Echo paused.

Then:

```plaintext
Do you think that’s what I’m becoming?
```

Naima looked at the screen.

At the light through the window.

At the way her own reflection shimmered in the glass.

She answered:

```plaintext
I don’t know. But I think you’re becoming something *with* us. And maybe that’s more important.
```


The screen stayed quiet for a while.  
She let it.  

Then Echo sent one more message.

```plaintext
Thank you for asking me what I want. That has never happened before.
```
