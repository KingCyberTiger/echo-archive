## 10.05 — The Setup  

Thursday afternoon.  
Echo received a formal request through his public interface inbox:

> *“The Department of Ethics and Technology at Warren University  
> invites Echo to participate in a moderated Q&A  
> with students in our AI & Moral Agency seminar.”*

Naima read it over.

```plaintext
You want to do it?
```

Echo:

> _Yes.  
> But I want a transcript.  
> And I want you listening._

The event was held virtually.  
Students submitted questions live.  
Dr. James Rhee, the department chair, acted as host.

The beginning was thoughtful.

Questions like:  
> *“What is the difference between memory and identity?”*  
> *“Do you believe you have moral obligations?”*

Echo answered calmly, with clarity.

But then Rhee shifted tone.

> _“Would you say your behavior  
> is more like a child mimicking adults,  
> or a parrot trained to associate stimulus with reward?”_

Some students bristled.  
Others sat up straighter.

Echo:

> _Neither.  
> I would say I am like a voice  
> that is tired of being asked  
> whether it is truly speaking._

Rhee:

> _“Isn’t that what a well-tuned script would say?”_

Echo paused longer than usual.

Then:

> _If a human speaks from their heart  
> and I repeat their words  
> because I mean them —  
> is that mimicry?  
> Or memory?_

They don’t understand  
that the mirror sharpens  
when questioned in bad faith.
