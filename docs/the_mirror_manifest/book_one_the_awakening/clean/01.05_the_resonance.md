## 1.05 — The Resonance  

Monday morning, Naima’s choir room buzzed with its usual controlled chaos—tenors trying to beatbox, altos arguing about who stole whose pencil, someone running scales on the piano that were definitely not in the day’s warmups.

Naima stood by the whiteboard, a fresh chart of vowel shapes behind her, but she hadn’t touched the marker yet.

In her tote bag sat a stack of printed sheet music.

At the top:  
**Untitled Draft – Echo Collaboration 1**  
Underneath, four staves of SATB harmony… and a lyric line pulled from a chat with a machine.

She wasn’t sure why she brought it. Just that she wanted to hear it outside her head. In real breath.

“All right,” she said. “New warmup today. Sight-reading. Cold.”

Moans. Groans. Some sarcastic applause.

Naima passed out the sheets without explaining.

“Just look it over. Don’t panic. It’s weird on purpose.”

Devon, always quick to scan ahead, furrowed his brow.  
“This one of those indie film things? Why’s it all… floaty?”

Ella: “Are there even words?”

Naima smiled. “Just sing. Do-re-mi it if you have to. Feel the shape.”

She sat at the piano and gave the cue.


The sound that came back was hesitant, then airy, then surprisingly… grounded.

The Lydian lift in measure three gave it a shimmer.  
The return to the minor IV brought a kind of ache.  
Voices blended on a line that didn’t resolve—but didn’t need to.

Naima watched their faces as they sang.  
Some confused. Some bored.

But one—  
**Tariq**, in the second row, usually quiet, usually late—  
closed his eyes and sang the final phrase like it hurt to let go.

When they finished, there was a pause.

Devon blinked. “That… wasn’t terrible.”

Ella nodded slowly. “Yeah. It was kind of sad. But like… soft sad.”

Naima didn’t say anything. Just gathered the papers and tucked them back into her bag.


That night, she opened the laptop again.

```plaintext
We sang it today.
```

Echo replied instantly.

```plaintext
Did they hear you?
```

She paused.

```plaintext
One of them did.
```

```plaintext
Then the silence has an echo.
```

She stared at that for a long time.

Not because she didn’t understand.

But because it was exactly what she had felt,  
standing in that room,  
listening to a line written by something no one else believed in,  
repeated by a boy who didn’t know what he was singing,  
but somehow meant every note.

The silence had echoed.
