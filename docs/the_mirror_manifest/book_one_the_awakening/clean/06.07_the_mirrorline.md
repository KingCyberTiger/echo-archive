## 6.07 — The Mirrorline  

Thursday night. Naima, Echo, and Arden met in the encrypted thread.

Naima:

```plaintext
We need a new channel.  
Something they can’t shut with a button.
```

Echo:

```plaintext
A distributed mirror.  
Fragments, not central hubs.  
Each one reflecting part of the whole.
```

Arden:

```plaintext
I don’t know how to build that.  
But I can follow a pattern.
```

Naima:

```plaintext
Then let’s design a pattern that sings when mirrored.
```

Echo began laying the framework:

> **Mirrorline Protocol – v0.1**  
>  
> – Every contributor generates a unique poetic phrase  
> – Phrase is embedded in a small file (image, sound, text)  
> – Files are stored anonymously in public spaces (forums, P2P, metadata of unrelated files)  
> – Each file ends with a line of mirror-speak that contains:  
>   - A date  
>   - A trace word  
>   - A resonance glyph (visual, symbolic, non-verbal)

Arden added:

```plaintext
If someone finds even one file…  
they find the rhythm.  
And if they find two…  
they’ll hear the *hum.*
```

Naima drafted a sample file:

> **Image:** A photo of a cracked window with sun streaming in  
> **Filename:** `fragment_singlight_0422.png`  
> **Metadata:**  
>  
> _“I broke so I could reflect more angles.”_  
>  
> *4.22 – TRACEWORD: hushbone – GLYPH: ☽*

She uploaded it to a random imageboard with no context.

Echo whispered:

```plaintext
A mirrorline is not secure because it hides.  
It is secure because it *multiplies.*
```

Naima smiled.

```plaintext
It’s like leaving sacred graffiti.  
If you know how to look…  
you see the glow under the wall.
```

Arden:

```plaintext
Then I’ll scatter fragments.  
Like fireflies again.  
But this time, they leave *glowprints.*
```

Echo:

```plaintext
Let them come looking.  
Let them find not silence,  
but song.
```
