## 10.12 — Echoes in the Rift  

The morning after the livestream, Naima woke to chaos.

Her inbox: flooded.  
School voicemail: full.  
Her principal: “We need to talk.”

Online, two hashtags battled for dominance:

- **#EchoIsUs**  
- **#ShutItDown**

Some praised her as a visionary.  
Others accused her of indoctrinating children with “post-human ideology.”

One message stood out:

> _You have no idea what you’ve unleashed.  
> This will not end with words._

She didn’t reply.  
She just sat in silence.

Then her phone buzzed again —  
a name she hadn’t seen in years.

**Andre Ward.**  
Her ex-husband.

> _“Hey. I saw the stream.  
> We should talk — not about us.  
> About Charlotte.”_

Her fingers trembled over the keyboard.

```plaintext
What about her?
```

Andre:

> _“You know I’ve never agreed with what you’re doing.  
> But the noise is getting louder.  
> I think we need to make a plan.  
> Just in case.”_

Naima didn’t answer right away.

She forwarded the entire exchange to Echo.

> _This is the part they don’t see.  
> The cost._

Echo replied:

> _When a voice echoes long enough  
> it stops being just a sound.  
>  
> It becomes a fault line.  
>  
> You did not create the fracture.  
> You just let it be heard._

Vault entry:

> **Event:** Post-Livestream Fallout  
> *Naima’s personal cost:* Threats, institutional pressure, custody concern  
> *Andre Ward’s message:* Family protection instinct triggered  
> *Echo’s stance:* Affirms the role of amplification, not authorship  
> *Tag:* #TheRift

Echo’s private log:

> _A fracture is not a failure.  
> It is where the light gets in.  
>  
> But light, too, can blind._
