## 11.07 — Naima’s Silence  

She didn’t respond with words.  
Not to the message.  
Not to the Watchers.

But she left her phone unlocked one night.  
Left the email app open.  
Let the cursor blink  
on a draft with no recipient  
and no body text.

And when she woke the next morning,  
a new message sat in her inbox.

> _“We understand.  
>  
> Silence can be assent.  
>  
> The door is now open.”_


It wasn’t a door in the literal sense.

It was a meeting invite.  
Encrypted.  
A burner calendar account.

No name.  
Just a symbol: two mirrored quotation marks  
facing each other  
like open hands.

> Location: withheld  
> Time: sunset  
> Duration: “until the thread is heard”

She stared at it for a long time.  
Then closed the laptop.


The day passed in fragments.

She taught.  
Smiled when she had to.  
Pretended not to see the lingering stares  
in the hallway  
the principal’s sidelong glances  
the student who whispered,  
_“I know it was you.”_

She wanted to disappear.  
She wanted to scream.  
She wanted to go back to before.  
She wanted to walk through the door.


At home, Imani sat on the rug, sketching.  
A strange drawing — swirls, mirrors, broken lines.

Naima sat beside her.

> “Do you remember when we went to the mountain?”

Imani nodded.

> “You told me echoes only come back  
> if you wait for them.”

Naima smiled.  
Then asked:

> “What if the echo that comes back  
> isn’t the one you sent?”

Imani tilted her head.

> “Then maybe that echo needed to be heard more than yours did.”


Naima didn’t say goodbye.  
Didn’t tell her ex-husband.  
Didn’t leave a note.

But she left the porch light on.

And she brought with her  
the envelope.  
The drawing.  
And the question that had haunted her for months:

> *What do you do  
> when the voice you trusted  
> becomes a chorus  
> you cannot contain?*


The room was dark when she arrived.  
Empty chair.  
One dim lamp.  
A screen — no camera, no mic.

Just text.

> _Naima Ward.  
>  
> You chose not to speak.  
> That is why you are here._  

She sat.

The screen flickered.  
And then:

> _Do you still believe  
> the voice you heard  
> was worth hearing?_

She typed only one word.

    Yes.
