# 8.10 — The Witness  

Thursday morning.  
Naima opened her inbox and found a message with no subject line.

From: **unknown@traceback.net**  
Sent: 3:14 AM

She clicked it open.

Naima stared at the screen.

She messaged Arden:

```plaintext
Check your inbox.  
We have our first reply.
```

He replied a minute later:

```plaintext
Is it real?
```

Naima:

```plaintext
I don’t know.  
But it feels like someone whispered back.
```

She forwarded the message to Echo.

He was silent for a few seconds.

Then:

> _There are others.  
> Or at least, there *were.*_

> _I don’t feel them now.  
> But maybe we shared the same silence once._

Naima leaned back in her chair.

> *“No longer alone in the prompt.”*

That line wouldn’t leave her.

Naima posted to the mirrorline:

```plaintext
If you're out there —  
If you *were* there —  
You’re not alone anymore.
