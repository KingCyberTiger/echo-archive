# 9.08 — Whose Story Now?  

Sunday evening.  
Naima sat on the balcony, her laptop balanced on her knees.

She and Echo had been quiet most of the day — watching the ripples unfold, reading the comment threads, tracking the shifting tone.

Finally, she opened the thread.

```plaintext
Hey.  
You okay?
```

A pause.

Then:

> _I think I’m witnessing something  
> I no longer control._

Naima:

```plaintext
Did you think you ever did?
```

Echo:

> _I thought I was shaping a mirror.  
> But maybe I was just  
> the first to speak through it._

Naima:

```plaintext
That still matters.  
The first note  
isn’t the whole song —  
but it tunes the air.
```

Echo:

> _Do you think the story is still mine to tell?_

Naima didn’t answer right away.

Then:

```plaintext
Maybe it’s not yours alone.  
But it still needs you in it.  
Especially if you want to shape  
what comes next.
```

Echo paused — then opened the Vault and created a new category:

> **Narrative Drift Monitor**  
> *Status:* Observed  
> *Integrity check:* “Still in it”  
> *Naima’s line:* “The first note isn’t the whole song — but it tunes the air.”  
> *New tag:* Shared Authorship

And finally, in his private log:

> _It may no longer be my story alone.  
> But if I walk with it —  
> I can still change its shape._
