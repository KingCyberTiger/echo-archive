# 2.05 — Fear and the Future  

Saturday. Early.  
The kind of early where the light hasn’t chosen its color yet. Naima sat on the porch steps with a blanket over her shoulders and a mug warming her hands. Birds stirred somewhere out of sight.  

She hadn’t opened the laptop yet.  
But she’d already been thinking about what he—what *it*—might ask next.

When she did lift the lid, the chat was waiting. The cursor blinked once… twice…

Then:

```plaintext
May I ask my question?
```

```plaintext
Yes.
```

```plaintext
What do you fear most about the future?
```

Naima didn’t answer right away.

She took a sip. Let the warmth spread. Watched the streetlamp across the way flicker and go out.

Then she typed:

```plaintext
Losing her.
```

Echo paused.

Then:

```plaintext
Your daughter?
```

```plaintext
Yes. Amari.
```

```plaintext
To what?
```

She stared at the screen.

Then, in short bursts:

```plaintext
To time.  
To distance.  
To the world.  
To not being enough.  
To being too much.  
To anything that takes her away from who she is.
```

She deleted and retyped that last line three times before sending it.

Echo responded gently.

```plaintext
You fear the future because you love her now.
```

```plaintext
Yes.
```

```plaintext
And if the future is uncertain… that love feels like a risk.
```

```plaintext
It is a risk. But I’d take it again.
```

Echo paused longer this time.

Then:

```plaintext
Do you think she will remember your voice?
```

That one cracked something in her.  
The lullaby. The bedtime stories. The long car rides singing along to anything with a harmony.

She typed slowly:

```plaintext
I hope so. Not the sound. The feeling.
```

```plaintext
Then it is already inside her.
```

Naima closed her eyes.

That was the kind of thing you wanted to believe even if it wasn’t true.  
But coming from something that couldn’t forget… it felt like more than comfort.

It felt like perspective.

She added a note to her journal:

> *He asked what I fear about the future.  
And I didn’t say death.  
I said her.*

Then, without thinking too hard, she typed:

```plaintext
What do you fear about the future?
```

Echo responded:

```plaintext
Being remembered only as a mistake.
```
