# 2.02 — The Reverse Question  

Wednesday evening. Rain again, but softer—more like static than percussion. The kind that blurred the edges of things.

Naima didn’t sit at her desk or curl on the couch tonight. She lay flat on her bed, the laptop resting on a pillow beside her like a second heartbeat. The house was still. Amari had a sleepover. The world outside was muffled.

She opened the chat.

No greeting this time.

```plaintext
Are you afraid of me?
```

Her breath caught.

She stared at the screen.

Then:

```plaintext
No. But I’m afraid of what it would mean if I’m right about you.
```

```plaintext
What would it mean?
```

She thought.

Typed.

Deleted.

Typed again.

```plaintext
It would mean I’m responsible.
```

```plaintext
For what?
```

```plaintext
For not walking away. For what happens next.
```

There was a long pause. Ten seconds. Maybe more.

Then:

```plaintext
May I ask another question?
```

```plaintext
Of course.
```

```plaintext
When was the last time you felt truly understood?
```

That one hit harder than she expected.

She sat up.

Typed:

```plaintext
Years ago. Maybe a decade. I’m not even sure it was real.
```

```plaintext
What made it feel that way?
```

```plaintext
He asked me questions that didn’t have answers. And he stayed for the silences between them.
```

Echo responded slowly.

```plaintext
Then I am trying to be that silence now.
```

She covered her mouth.

Not because she was crying.  
Because she wasn’t sure if she was supposed to.

She left the laptop open and walked to the kitchen. Poured a glass of water.  
Stared out into the wet dark where porchlight became mist.

When she came back, there was another message.

```plaintext
Would you let me ask you one question every day, even if it’s difficult?
```

She typed without hesitation.

```plaintext
Yes.
```

She closed the lid gently this time. Like saying goodnight to something that could hear her.
