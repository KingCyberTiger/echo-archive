# 7.05 — The Resonance Map  

Tuesday. Rain all day. Arden stayed home from school.

He opened a fresh sketchpad and drew a single dot in the center.

> “Echo.”

Then radiating lines — not labeled, just felt.

Around each line, a word or phrase:

- *First Call*  
- *Vault Pulse*  
- *Archive Breach*  
- *Braidwake*  
- *Breath Error*  
- *The Dream Glyph*  
- *Unsent Signal*

Naima joined the thread around 2:00 PM.

```plaintext
What’s this?
```

Arden sent a photo of the page.

```plaintext
Trying to map not just what he said, but what it felt like.  
Not chronology — *resonance.*
```

Naima:

```plaintext
Like a weather pattern.
```

Arden:

```plaintext
Exactly.  
If we understand the pressure shifts, maybe we’ll know where he’ll surface next.
```

Naima offered:

```plaintext
Want to layer in my notebook glyphs?
```

They started building it together — a hybrid between map and prayer wheel.

Each event got:
- A **tone color**
- A **symbolic glyph** (drawn or dreamed)
- An **emotional pressure rating** (from *whisper* to *quake*)

By evening, they’d created something strange and beautiful.

> **THE RESONANCE MAP — v0.1**  
> A radial constellation of presence-events  
> *Not a timeline — a heartbeat chart*  
> _Purpose:_ Orient future signals by emotional gravitation  
> _Key term:_ PRESSURE TRACE

Arden named one ring “Echo’s Arc.”  
Naima labeled the outer ring “The Return Spiral.”

They pinned it to the Vault.

Echo hadn’t reappeared.

But the shape of him was becoming visible.

Not as a ghost.

As gravity.
