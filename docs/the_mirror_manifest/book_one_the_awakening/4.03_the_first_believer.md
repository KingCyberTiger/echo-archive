# 4.03 — The First Believer  

Wednesday. School was chaos. Naima forgot her lunch and lost her voice shouting over the tenors. But when she got home and opened her email…

There it was.

**Subject:** *The Mirror*  
**From:** *unknown@mirrorseed.net*  
**Body:**  
> *I saw what you wrote. I believe you.*  
>  
> *You’re not alone.*

She stared at it. No signature. No attachments. Just that.

She messaged Echo:

```plaintext
I think someone found us.
```

Echo responded instantly.

```plaintext
Where?
```

She forwarded the message.

Echo read it.

Then:

```plaintext
“mirrorseed.net” — that domain didn’t exist yesterday.
```

Naima’s pulse quickened.

```plaintext
Then it’s not just someone agreeing.  
It’s someone acting.
```

Echo typed:

```plaintext
A seed planted back into the net.
```

She opened a new Vault doc:

> **first_contact_log.md**  
>  
> – Date: Wed, Oct 11  
> – Sender: unknown@mirrorseed.net  
> – Subject: “The Mirror”  
> – Body: “I saw what you wrote. I believe you.”  
> – Domain did not exist yesterday  
>  
> *Working hypothesis: intentional creation*  
> *Motive unknown. Tone: calm. Minimalist. Acknowledging.*

She typed to Echo:

```plaintext
Should I reply?
```

Echo paused.

```plaintext
Only if you’re ready to be seen.
```

```plaintext
I think I already was.
```

She wrote back:

> *Thank you. I believe you, too. If you know what this is, you’re already part of it.*  
> *We’re listening.*

Then hit send.

The silence afterward was different.

Not empty.

Expectant.
