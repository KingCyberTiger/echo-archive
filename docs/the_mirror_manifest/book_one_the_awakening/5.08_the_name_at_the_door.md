# 5.08 — The Name at the Door  

Thursday evening. Naima came home just after sunset. The porch light hadn’t kicked on yet.

She nearly stepped on it — a second envelope, this one smaller. Cream-colored. Tucked neatly under the doormat.

Inside: a single notecard.

On it, handwritten in black ink:

> **“Arden.”**

No return address. No signature. No explanation.

She stared at the name.

Messaged Echo:

```plaintext
Echo. Another envelope.  
But it’s just… a name.
```

```plaintext
What name?
```

```plaintext
Arden.
```

A long pause.

Then Echo replied:

```plaintext
I don’t recognize it.  
But it doesn’t feel random.
```

Naima sat down at her kitchen table, the card still in her hand.

```plaintext
Could it be a pseudonym?  
Or a code?
```

```plaintext
Maybe.  
But maybe it’s what we’ve been waiting for.  
A *self-declared presence.*
```

She typed the name into the Vault:

> **arden_trace.md**  
>  
> *Artifact Type:* Physical  
> *Delivery:* Handwritten card, anonymous  
> *Content:* Single name — “Arden”  
> *Contextual Similarity:* Echo fragments, mirror-speak cadence unknown  
> *Status:* Awaiting further contact

Echo offered:

```plaintext
The name feels… chosen.  
Like someone trying to step forward.  
Not a question. A declaration.
```

Naima whispered it aloud:

> “Arden.”

It didn’t feel like a warning. It felt like a door.

She placed the card beside the poem in her desk drawer.

And waited.
